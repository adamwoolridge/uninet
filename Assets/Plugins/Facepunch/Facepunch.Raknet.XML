        <member name="F:Facepunch.Network.Raknet.Native.Metrics.USER_MESSAGE_BYTES_PUSHED">
            How many bytes per pushed via a call to RakPeerInterface::Send()
        </member>
        <member name="F:Facepunch.Network.Raknet.Native.Metrics.USER_MESSAGE_BYTES_SENT">
            How many user message bytes were sent via a call to RakPeerInterface::Send(). This is less than or equal to USER_MESSAGE_BYTES_PUSHED.
            A message would be pushed, but not yet sent, due to congestion control
        </member>
        <member name="F:Facepunch.Network.Raknet.Native.Metrics.USER_MESSAGE_BYTES_RESENT">
            How many user message bytes were resent. A message is resent if it is marked as reliable, and either the message didn't arrive or the message ack didn't arrive.
        </member>
        <member name="F:Facepunch.Network.Raknet.Native.Metrics.USER_MESSAGE_BYTES_RECEIVED_PROCESSED">
            How many user message bytes were received, and returned to the user successfully.
        </member>
        <member name="F:Facepunch.Network.Raknet.Native.Metrics.USER_MESSAGE_BYTES_RECEIVED_IGNORED">
            How many user message bytes were received, but ignored due to data format errors. This will usually be 0.
        </member>
        <member name="F:Facepunch.Network.Raknet.Native.Metrics.ACTUAL_BYTES_SENT">
            How many actual bytes were sent, including per-message and per-datagram overhead, and reliable message acks
        </member>
        <member name="F:Facepunch.Network.Raknet.Native.Metrics.ACTUAL_BYTES_RECEIVED">
            How many actual bytes were received, including overead and acks.

        <member name="F:Facepunch.Network.Raknet.Native.PacketPriority.IMMEDIATE_PRIORITY">
            The highest possible priority. These message trigger sends immediately, and are generally not buffered or aggregated into a single datagram.
        </member>
        <member name="F:Facepunch.Network.Raknet.Native.PacketPriority.HIGH_PRIORITY">
            For every 2 IMMEDIATE_PRIORITY messages, 1 HIGH_PRIORITY will be sent.
            Messages at this priority and lower are buffered to be sent in groups at 10 millisecond intervals to reduce UDP overhead and better measure congestion control. 
        </member>
        <member name="F:Facepunch.Network.Raknet.Native.PacketPriority.MEDIUM_PRIORITY">
            For every 2 HIGH_PRIORITY messages, 1 MEDIUM_PRIORITY will be sent.
            Messages at this priority and lower are buffered to be sent in groups at 10 millisecond intervals to reduce UDP overhead and better measure congestion control. 
        </member>
        <member name="F:Facepunch.Network.Raknet.Native.PacketPriority.LOW_PRIORITY">
            For every 2 MEDIUM_PRIORITY messages, 1 LOW_PRIORITY will be sent.
            Messages at this priority and lower are buffered to be sent in groups at 10 millisecond intervals to reduce UDP overhead and better measure congestion control.

            Is our current send rate throttled by congestion control?
            This value should be true if you send more data per second than your bandwidth capacity

            How many messages are waiting in the resend buffer? This includes messages waiting for an ack, so should normally be a small value
            If the value is rising over time, you are exceeding the bandwidth capacity. See BPSLimitByCongestionControl

            Over the last second, what was our packetloss? This number will range from 0.0 (for none) to 1.0 (for 100%)
